# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
## https://tchhabs.github.io/Plotly-Dashboard/
An interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to create visualizations to explore a belly button biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
